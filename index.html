                **Ridgewater, November 15, 2024** — In a surprising turn of events, several residents of Ridgewater reported seeing a mysterious light in the sky late last night. Witnesses described the object as a disc-shaped craft with blue and green lights, hovering silently over the Henderson Barn for approximately an hour before disappearing at high speed.

                Local authorities have stated they are investigating the incident, though no official explanation has been provided. "At this time, we believe the sighting may be related to weather phenomena or a possible military test," said Ridgewater Police Chief Sarah Manning. "We are working closely with federal agencies to determine the cause." However, some local residents remain unconvinced.
